Introduction
============

Benchmarking of ML algorithms requires an efficient 
collection of dataset to observe the performance of the 
machine learning algorithms.

One simple method is to create small dummy data which are 
linear and non-linear to see where certain algorithms fail 
and succeed.

The `visual-data-gen` is a visual canvas tool that allows to
generate data with just click. 

Usage
=====

You can visit the web app at 
[here](https://smc181002.me/visual-data-gen). You will 
be presented with a canvas where you just need to click on
the canvas like a whiteboard and generate the dataset.

You can generate data with labels by clicking on the multiple
colors provided in the control menu at the bottom.

Don't want this dataset? Just click on the clear button and 
everything will be gone and you will be presented with a 
white canvas.

When you are done with your generation, click on the 
download button and a `.csv` file gets downloaded to your
desired location.

And yes...you are done with your dataset generation and 
ready to start playing with the data and algorithms.
