                <!-- Hi! My name is Meher Chaitanya and I am currently a <b>4th year student</b>  at the University of Hyderabad, pursuing my <b> I.M.Tech </b> degree. I have a strong background in dev-ops and cloud computing, and have gained hands-on experience working with various tools and technologies in these areas. Some of the dev-ops tools that I have worked with include containers with Kubernetes and OpenShift, and CI/CD with Jenkins. In the realm of cloud computing, I have experience working with tools such as AWS, OpenFaaS, and Minio.
            </p>
            <p>
                To demonstrate my skills and knowledge, I have built several mini projects at an industry level. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in a practical setting, and have given me valuable experience working on real-world problems. Here is the link for the <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}projects`} class="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-300 font-roboto-flex">projects</a>  page
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my work on these projects, I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise through blogging. I write about the concepts and technologies that I have mastered in order to help others learn and grow, as well as to give back to the tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am a driven and ambitious individual with a strong desire to make a positive impact in the tech industry. I am excited to see where my passions and skills will take me in the future, and I am always open to new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer
            </p> -->
            <p>
                Namaste Everyone üôè, This is Sri Meher Chaitanya Varma Nadimpalli. 
                I go by the name Meher Chaitanya in the net but you are free to 
                choose any one of the names over there üòâ. I am currently a 
                student at <a href="https://uohyd.ac.in">University of Hyderabad</a>
                Pursuing Integrated M.Tech in Computer Sciences at 
                <a href="https://scis.uohyd.ac.in" class="">School of Computer and Information Sciences</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests and skills currently lie in Cloud computing and web development
                but I am constantly exploring and expanding my knowledge into more innovative
                fields of Machine Learning and Internet of Things to create the future
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently Interning at GE (General Electric Vernova) and contributing to 
                what can be called as the humankind's greatest invention - The Electricity Grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming to my learning experience, I tend to follow a way of learning designed by myself
                with experience from my childhood. When diving into a concept, first thing is to explore
                about the concepts in a higher level. And after each iteration, go deeper in each concept.
                This is something similar to how a BFS algorithm traverses the tree. I tend to do projects
                in the concepts that I want to master which stands as a proof and application of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blogging is the part of my learning process that concludes my learning by sharing my knowledge 
                and also acting as a material for future reference. You can checkout my
                blogs at <a href="https://smc181002.medium.com" target="_blank">medium.com</a>
